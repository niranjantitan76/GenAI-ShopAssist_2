## General Information
> Our project aims to build a chat boat. Online shopping has become the go-to option for many consumers.
However, the overwhelming number of choices and the lack of personalized assistance can make the shopping
experience daunting. To address this, we have developed **ShopAssist AI, a chatbot that combines the power of
large language models and rule-based functions to ensure accurate and reliable information delivery**.
